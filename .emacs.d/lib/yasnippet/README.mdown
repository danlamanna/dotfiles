# Intro

**YASnippet** is a template system for Emacs. It allows you to type an
abbreviation and automatically expand it into function
templates. Bundled language templates includes: C, C++, C#, Perl,
Python, Ruby,

SQL, LaTeX, HTML, CSS and more. The snippet syntax is inspired from
[TextMate's][textmate-snippets] syntax, you can even
[import][import-docs] most TextMate templates to YASnippet. Watch
[a demo on YouTube][youtube-demo] or download a
[higher resolution version][high-res-demo]

# Installation 

## Install the most recent version

Clone this repository somewhere

    $ cd ~/.emacs.d/plugins 
    $ git clone https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet

Add the following in your `.emacs` file:

    (add-to-list 'load-path
                  "~/.emacs.d/plugins/yasnippet")
    (require 'yasnippet) ;; not yasnippet-bundle
    (yas/global-mode 1)

Add your own snippets to `~/.emacs.d/snippets` by placing files there or invoking `yas/new-snippet`.

## Install yasnippet with el-get

El-get is a nice way to get the most recent version, too

See https://github.com/dimitri/el-get for instructions

# Contributing snippets

Please do not ask me to add snippets to the default collection under
`/snippets`. This is considered frozen and by customizing
`yas/snippet-dirs` you can point yasnippet to good snippet collections
out there.

There is a tool `extras/textmate-import.rb` than can import many
actual Textmate snippets and there are
`extras/imported/*-mode/.yas-setup.el` files that can help it with the
more difficult importation. 

I'm focusing on developping `textmate-import.rb` tool and the
`yas-setup.el` files. In the future `/snippets` snippets will be
deprecated and replaced with `extras/imported`. 

Follow through the following example to start using these snippets for
rails development. It will convert `ruby`, `rails` and `html` bundles
from drnic's github repositories based on corresponding
`.yas-setup.el` files.

## Using imported textmate snippets (rails example)

After cloning this repository to `~/.emacs.d/plugins/yasnippet`
   
    cd ~/.emacs.d/plugins/yasnippet
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    gem install plist trollop
    rake convert_bundles             # will convert ruby, rails and html bundles from drnic
    
Then, in your .emacs file

    (add-to-list 'load-path
                  "~/.emacs.d/plugins/yasnippet")
    (require 'yasnippet)
    (setq yas/snippet-dirs '("~/.emacs.d/snippets" "~/.emacs.d/extras/imported"))
    (yas/global-mode 1)    
     
Open some rails file (model, app, etc) and start using the textmate snippets.
