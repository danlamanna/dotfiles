  "Creates a cached hash table.  This is a hash table where
elements expire at some condition, as specified by init-fun and
test-fun.  The three arguments do as follows:

init-fun is a function that is called when a new item is inserted
into the cache.

test-fun is a function that is called when an item in the cache
is looked up.  It takes one argument, and will be passed the
result of init-fun that was generated when the item was inserted
into the cache.

cleanup-fun is called when an item is removed from the hash
table.  It takes one argument, the value of the key-value pair
being deleted.

Note that values are only deleted from the cache when accessed.

This will return a list of 4 elements: a has table and the 3
arguments.  All hash-table functions will work on the car of this
list, although if accessed directly the lookups will return a pair
(value, (init-fun)).

The keyword arguments are the same as for make-hash-table and are applied
to the created hash table."
